## Getting Started

First, we have to install **virtualenv** to start the project in command prompt.
`
pip install virtualenv
`

Then, we need to create virtualenv by running below code:
`
virtualenv <name_of_your_environment>
`

After installation we need to activate virtualenv by running:
`
.\env\Scripts\activate
`

Once virtualenv is activated.
Execute these commands to build your Django project

```
pip install django
django-admin startproject <project_name>
python manage.py startapp <app_name>
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

FInally, after executing all these steps you should keep your file structure similar to these project.
Then run these command to **migarte** all the changes/
`
python manage.py migrate
`

Now, to start with running your application run this command:
`
python manage.py runserver
`
